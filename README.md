The purpose of the app is to evaluate the P&L that would have been generated by a specific portfolio composed of options and/or futures over a given time period, by decomposing the P&L based on the portfolio Greeks.

The inputs to the script are:
-start date
-end date
-options and futures in the portfolio

For options, there is the possibility to keep them either "live" or "hedged". In the latter case, the application performs daily delta hedging at the close.
